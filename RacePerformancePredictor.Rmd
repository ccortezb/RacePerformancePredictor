Avoiding the [Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pttqFUviWs) in a marathon requires careful pacing over the first half of the race. Given the length of the race and the time it takes to recover, most runners only attempt a marathon race a 1-2 times a year, making it difficult to accurately predict their target pace. The most widely-used [methods for predicting performance](http://run-down.com/statistics/calcs_explained.php) are all pretty [old](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~phoffman/xcinfo3.html). As a statistician, these methods also frustrate me in not providing a target range. In this report, I use empirical observations of personal bests available from www.athlinks.com to derive a new and improved marathon performance predictor.

The ultimate goal is to answer the question *what should my goal for a marathon be based on a recent half-marathon performance?*

# THIS CAN TAKE MANY HOURS
if(file.exists("data/pb_data.Rda")) {
  load("data/pb_data.Rda")
  #pb_data <- read.csv("pb_data.csv")
  } else {
    print("Need race results data. Load pb_data.Rda or run script `source(getPBdata.R)")
  }
```

# Data

I collected personal best times from a haphazard sample of athletes on (http://www.athlinks.com/) that had a marathon best time listed. To select the best data possible, I pulled results for the top 100 athletes from 15 regions, sorted by  `Race Count`, under the assumption that athletes with the most races would be more likley to have complete data (see details in `getPBdata.R` script). Further data cleaning yielded data a total of 1,333 athletes.

For these athletes, the plot of distance against race time shows a wider range at longer distances, as would be expected.

```{r eda, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# remove gender not M/F
pb_data <- pb_data %>%
  filter(gender %in% c("M", "F"))

# subset races
pb_data_sub <- pb_data %>%
  filter(distance %in% c("1/2 Mara", "Marathon", "5K", "10K", "15K Run", "20K Run", "5Mi Run", "10Mi Run"))

# add distance in km for races
pb_data_sub <- pb_data_sub %>%
  mutate(distancekm = ifelse(distance == "Marathon", 42.2,
                             ifelse(distance == "1/2 Mara", 21.1, 
                                    ifelse(distance == "20K Run", 20,
                                           ifelse(distance == "10Mi Run", 16.12,
                                                  ifelse(distance == "15K Run", 15,
                                                         ifelse(distance == "10K", 10,
                                                                ifelse(distance == "5Mi Run", 8.05,
                                                                       ifelse(distance == "5K", 5, NA)))))))))

# plot
g1 <- ggplot(pb_data_sub, aes(x = distancekm, y = totalseconds, group = id, color = gender)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  xlab("Distance (KM)") + 
  ylab("Total time (sec)") + 
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Gender")

suppressWarnings(g1)
```

Grouping by gender and plotting on a log-scale, we see that men (blue) tend to be faster than women (red lines) at all distances.

```{r eda2, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g2 <- ggplot(pb_data_sub, aes(x = distancekm, y = log(totalseconds), group = gender, color = gender)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Distance (KM)") + 
  ylab("log(Total time) (sec)") + 
  scale_colour_discrete(name = "Gender")

suppressWarnings(g2)
```

However, grouping by gender ignores significant variation among athletes in performance. I calculated each athletes 'rank' in comparison to all other athletes in the dataset, and took their average rank across distances. As the dataset includes national caliber (e.g. 61 minute half-marathon) to much slower (e.g. 3 hour half-marathon) runners, this is representative of the entire US running population. 

In this figure, it appears that highly-ranked runners (Rank top 1-5%, darker lines) slow down less than recreational runners (Rank > 75%, lighter lines). 

```{r rank, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# add indicator for caliber of athlete based on race times
pb_data_sub <- pb_data_sub %>%
  group_by(distance) %>%
  mutate(distancerank = round(percent_rank(totalseconds), 2)) 

# mean rank across distances
pb_data_sub <- ungroup(pb_data_sub)

pb_data_sub <- pb_data_sub %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  mutate(athRank = mean(distancerank),
         athRankR = round_any(athRank, accuracy = 0.05, f = round) * 100
         )

# plot by caliber and gender
g3 <- ggplot(pb_data_sub, aes(x = distancekm, y = totalseconds, group = athRankR, color = athRankR)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  xlab("Distance (KM)") + 
  ylab("Total time (sec)") +
  scale_colour_continuous(name = "Rank")

suppressMessages(g3)
```

# Method 1: predict change in pace with increasing distance

First, I tried to emulate methods that predict how much a runner's pace decreases in races of increasing distance. As the function of race time against distance appears to be nearly linear, I fit a linear model with a second-order polynomial to allow for slowing over longer distances, variables for gender and athlete rank, and allowed for interactions among all these.  

This figure shows the predicted values from the model (black lines) at Ranks of 10%, 50% and 90% for a male runner, against the raw data plotted in gray. This looks like a pretty good model!

```{r prediction, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# fit linear model
lm1 <- lm(totalseconds ~ distancekm * I(distancekm^2) * gender * athRank, data = pb_data_sub)
#summary(lm1)

# predict 
preddata <- data.frame(
  distancekm = rep(c(5, 10, 21.1, 20, 40, 42.2), times=3),
  gender = rep(c("M"), times=18),
  athRank = rep(c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), each=6, times=2),
  athRankR = rep(c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9), each=6, times=2))

plm1 <- predict(lm1, newdata=preddata, se.fit = TRUE)
plm1df <- cbind(preddata, pTime = plm1$fit, seTime = plm1$se.fit)


g4 <- ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(data=pb_data_sub, aes(x = distancekm, y = totalseconds, group = athRankR, color = athRankR)) +
  geom_line(data=plm1df, aes(x=distancekm, y= pTime, group=athRankR)) +
  scale_color_gradient(name = "Rank", low="lightgrey", high="darkgrey") +
  xlab("Distance (KM)") + 
  ylab("Total time (sec)")
g4
```

```{r gam, echo=FALSE, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
## NOT SHOWN

# allow speed to vary non-parametrically using generalized additive model (GAM)

gam1 <- gam(totalseconds ~ s(distancekm, k=5) + gender * athRank, data = pb_data_sub)
summary(gam1)
plot(gam1, residuals=T, pch=16)

# predict for gam
pgam1 <- predict(gam1, newdata=preddata, se.fit = TRUE)
pgam1df <- cbind(preddata, pTime = as.numeric(pgam1$fit),
                 seTime = as.numeric(pgam1$se.fit))

g5 <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=plm1df, aes(x=distancekm, y= pTime, group=athRankR, color = "red")) +
  geom_line(data=pgam1df, aes(x=distancekm, y=pTime, group=athRankR, color = "blue")) +
  xlab("Distance (KM)") + 
  ylab("Total time (sec)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_discrete()
g5
```

Intermediate to answering my ultimate question, I explored how much athletes of different ranks slowed down in races of increasing distances. From my observation above, I hypothesized that faster runners would slow less than slower runners. 

```{r slowdown, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# function to calculate percentage decrease in pace between a shorter (dist1) and longer distance (dist2)
paceSlowDown <- function(model, gen, athRankR, dist1, dist2) {
  df <- data.frame(
    distancekm = c(dist1, dist2),
    gender = rep(gen, 2),
    athRank = rep(athRankR/100, 2))
  
  df$pTime <- as.numeric(predict(model, newdata=df))
  df$pace <- df$pTime / df$distancekm
  
  S <- (df$pace[2] - df$pace[1]) / df$pace[1] * 100
  
    
(df$pace[2] / df$pace[1])
  
  return(round(S,1))
}

# compare rate of slow down as race length doubles for average athlete
psd1 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=50, dist1 = 5, dist2 = 10)
psd2 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=50, dist1 = 10, dist2 = 20)
psd3 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=50, dist1 = 21.1, dist2 = 42.2)

# compare rate of slow down between half and full marathon for different rank athletes
msd10 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=10, dist1 = 21.1, dist2 = 42.2)
msd50 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=50, dist1 = 21.1, dist2 = 42.2)
msd90 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=90, dist1 = 21.1, dist2 = 42.2)

msdf <- data.frame(
  athRank = c(10, 50, 90),
  slowdown = c(msd10, msd50, msd90))

ggplot(msdf, aes(athRank, slowdown)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  ylim(0, 15) +
  xlab("Athlete Rank") +
  ylab("Percent slow down from half to full marathon")
```

The above figure supports this hypothesis! Runners ranked in the top 10% only slow down by ~6% from the half to full marathon, whereas runners at the 90% rank slow by ~12%. 

# And my prediction is...

```{r jsg, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
filter(pb_data_sub, distance == "1/2 Mara", totalseconds < 4350, totalseconds > 4340)
# rank 5
msd05 <- paceSlowDown(lm1, gen="M", athRankR=5, dist1 = 21.1, dist2 = 42.2)
```

Taking this to a personal level, using my most recent half-marathon (1:12:22, 5th percentile) and the 5^th^ and 50^th^ percentiles as brackets, my predicted performance at a marathon is between `r toHMS(4343 * 2 + (4343 * 2 * msd05/100))` and `r toHMS(4343 * 2 + (4343 * 2 * msd50/100))`.

While the fast end of my predictions is on par with the current [performance calculators](http://www.runningforfitness.org/calc/racepaces/rp/rpother?dist=13.1&units=miles&hr=1&min=12&sec=23&age=33&gender=M&Submit=Calculate), the slow end is quite a bit slower, indicating that these tools may be setting unrealistic expectations for most runners!

The problem with this approach is that my estimate range came from my own expectations of my performance. 

# Method 2: predict time directly

In the previous section, I used data on times across distances to predict how much a runner's pace slows down as the distance increases. An alternate approach is to directly predict a marathon time from a half-marathon or other race time. I explored this approach here.

```{r pred2, echo=FALSE}
pb_data_sub2 <- filter(pb_data_sub, distance %in% c("1/2 Mara", "Marathon"))

# reshape data
#pb_spread <- spread(pb_data_sub2, distance, distancetime) #DOESN'T WORK?
# filter to half-marathon
pb_hm <- filter(pb_data_sub, distance == "1/2 Mara") %>%
  mutate(hmaratime = totalseconds) %>%
  select(id, hmaratime)
# filter to marathon
pb_m <- filter(pb_data_sub, distance == "Marathon") %>%
  mutate(maratime = totalseconds) %>%
  select(id, gender, athRank, athRankR, maratime)
# merge
pb_wide <- merge(pb_m, pb_hm)
pb_wide$gender <- as.factor(pb_wide$gender)
#str(pb_wide)

# fit model
lm2 <- lm(maratime ~ hmaratime + athRank * gender, data = pb_wide)
anova(lm2)
#summary(lm2)
#plot(lm2)

# NOTE - oddly, the model including the interaction between time and rank fits better, but the prediction (2:45:57) is crazy slow based on ground-truthing so I didn't use this model


# predict
myprediction <- predict(lm2, newdata = data.frame(hmaratime = 4343, gender = "M", athRank = 0.05), se.fit = TRUE)

# prediction
#toHMS(myprediction$fit)
# lower estimate
#toHMS(myprediction$fit - myprediction$se.fit)
# upper estimate
#toHMS(myprediction$fit + myprediction$se.fit)
```

The model output shows that half-marathon time and athlete rank are important predictors of marathon time, but gender doesn't matter when these factors are accounted for. Using this model, my marathon prediction is between **`r toHMS(myprediction$fit - myprediction$se.fit)` and `r toHMS(myprediction$fit + myprediction$se.fit)`**, which falls in the middle of the range from the pace slow-down approach above. This also supports the conclusion that current marathon performance predictors produce overly optimistic predictions for most runners.
